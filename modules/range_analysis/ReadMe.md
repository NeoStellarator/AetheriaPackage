# Mission analysis code

This folder contains the code for performing the mission analysis. Note that some functions still require unit tests so code is not guaranteed to be correct.
There are two main files you can run `geo_plotting.py`and `range_analysis.py`. Running `ShapeFileHandler.py` will not result in anything when run as the 
functions are not implemented anymore. `range_analysis.py`will give you a histogram fitted with a probability density function and `geo_plotting.py`a visualiztion
of all cities with their range visualized depending on the limit specified.

# Requirements for running

The required packages to run the code can be found in the main directory, instructions on how to get the packages can be found in the readme in the main directory.
